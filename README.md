## Use of Open-Source LLM to produce unstrutered responses in a Public Administration Database.

####This repository observes the performance of two open-source LLMs (Qwen-2 and Llama-3) in encoding a response in a database in comparison with that made by a Human.

####Two LLM models were used, one high-parameter ( Llama-3_70b) and the other low-parameter ( Qwen2_7b).

##Structure of this reposotory

###You can find two folders, one containing the python and R scripts used to carry out our analyses: "Script".
###And a second folder containing the CSV file we used to store our LLMs prompt: "Prompt"

###The python code could be realized thanks to the one produced by : Espinosa, L. and Salath√©, M. (2024). Using large language models as an evolutionary approach to understanding public health discourse (Version 2) [Software]. https://github.com/digitalepidemiologylab/llm_crowd_experts_annotation
